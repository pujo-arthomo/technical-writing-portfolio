# Decorative Glazing in Interior Design

Decorative glazing is using fancy glass in interiors. It can make spaces look beautiful.

Fritted glass has patterns baked into it. It's good for privacy and design.

Stained glass is old but still used in modern ways. Colored glass makes nice light effects.

Etched glass has designs cut into surface. It can be frosted for privacy.

Laminated glass with fabrics or films inside can have colors and textures.

These options help designers create unique looks while also providing function like sound control or safety.
