# Smart Light Switch - Installation Guide

## Safety First
Installation involves electrical wiring. If you are not a qualified electrician, hire a professional. Turn off power at the breaker and verify with a voltage tester.

This device complies with CE, FCC, UL, and Zigbee certification requirements.

## Required Tools
- Screwdriver
- Voltage tester
- Wire nuts

## Wiring Diagram (Text Description)
Typical single-pole installation:

- **Line (Live)**: Black wire from breaker → connect to device's LINE terminal
- **Load**: Black wire to light → connect to device's LOAD terminal
- **Neutral**: White wire → connect to device's NEUTRAL terminal (required for operation)
- **Ground**: Green/bare wire → connect to device's GROUND terminal

**Visual Illustration Description**:
Imagine a standard wall box with 4 wires. The switch has 4 labeled terminals on the back. Line and Load are on one side, Neutral and Ground on the other. Use wire nuts for secure connections.

For 3-way setups: Not supported in this model — use standard switches for multi-location control.

## Step-by-Step Installation
1. Remove old switch and expose wires.
2. Identify Line, Load, Neutral, and Ground.
3. Connect wires to corresponding terminals.
4. Secure the switch in the wall box.
5. Restore power and test manual operation.
6. Pair with app (see Quick-Start Guide).

## Post-Installation
Test on/off function. If LED flashes red, check wiring or neutral connection.

**Known Limitation**: Requires neutral wire (not compatible with older homes without neutral).
