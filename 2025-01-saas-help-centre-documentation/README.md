# SaaS Help Centre & Product Documentation

This documentation set represents a Help Centre structure for a SaaS product similar to an AI-powered trading journal.

The goal of this content is to help users:
- get started quickly
- understand how core features work
- manage their trading data
- interpret insights correctly
- solve common issues without contacting support

All articles are written as practical, step-by-step guides based on real product behavior.

This documentation focuses on usability and clarity, not marketing or promotional content.
