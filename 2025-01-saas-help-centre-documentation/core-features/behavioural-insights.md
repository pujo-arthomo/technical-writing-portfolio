# Understanding Behavioural Insights

Behavioural insights summarize patterns based on your logged trades.

These insights help highlight tendencies such as:
- overtrading
- holding losses too long
- inconsistent position sizing

Insights are descriptive, not predictive.

They are meant to support reflection, not provide trading advice.
