# Technical Writing Portfolio

Hello, I'm Pujo.

This repository contains samples of my technical writing, with a focus on creating **clear, honest, and user-friendly documentation** for internal tools and processes.

I emphasize:
- Simple, plain language for non-technical readers
- Logical structure and flow
- Transparent explanation of decisions and limitations
- Practical guidance that reduces confusion

The examples here are based on simulated internal tools and exercises.

### Samples

1. **[CSV File Renaming Tool Documentation](csv-file-renaming-tool.md)**  
   User guide for a simple Python script that adds consistent prefixes to CSV filenames.

2. **[Internal Request Submission Form Guide](internal-request-form.md)**  
   Documentation for a basic web form used by staff to submit routine requests.

More samples will be added over time.

Thank you for visiting!
