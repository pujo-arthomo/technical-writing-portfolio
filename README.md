# Technical Writing Portfolio

This repository contains samples of my technical writing work focused on internal documentation and process-oriented explanations.

The examples are based on simulated internal tools and workflows that reflect real-world documentation needs, such as explaining small scripts, manual processes, and user-facing internal tools.

The primary goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate how I:
- understand technical tasks and constraints
- document workflows clearly and honestly
- explain decisions and limitations without overclaiming
- write for non-technical or mixed audiences

## How to Read This Repository

Each folder represents one documentation task.

The folder names include a date to reflect when the task was originally completed.  
Inside each folder, you will find:
- a README file containing the documentation
- supporting files (such as scripts) when relevant

The documentation is written to be read independently.  
No prior knowledge of the code or tools is required.

## Scope and Focus

This portfolio focuses on:
- internal documentation
- process explanations
- small scripts and workflows
- clarity over complexity

It does not focus on:
- marketing content
- API references
- system architecture
- production-level engineering solutions

## Notes on Context

All examples in this repository are documentation exercises based on past internal-style requests.

They are not descriptions of proprietary systems or live production environments.  
The emphasis is on documentation quality, structure, and communication rather than implementation depth.

## Updates

This repository is updated selectively to reflect new documentation samples or refinements.
