## Power Requirements

The device operates within a specified voltage and current range.

Before connecting power:
- verify the available power supply matches the device rating
- ensure proper grounding is available
- confirm power is switched off

Incorrect power connections may cause permanent damage.

## Power Connection Procedure

Follow these steps to connect power:

1. Ensure the power source is disconnected.
2. Connect the ground conductor first.
3. Connect the power conductors according to the wiring diagram.
4. Secure all terminals to prevent loose connections.
5. Recheck wiring before applying power.

Do not apply power until all connections have been verified.

## Grounding

Proper grounding is required for:
- user safety
- signal stability
- protection against electrical faults

Connect the grounding terminal to a verified earth ground.

Never operate the device without proper grounding.

## Signal Wiring Considerations

When routing signal cables:
- separate power and signal wiring where possible
- avoid running cables near high-voltage sources
- use shielded cables if specified

Improper wiring may result in signal interference or unreliable readings.

## Post-Connection Checks

After wiring is complete:
- inspect all terminals
- ensure cables are strain-relieved
- confirm connectors are fully seated

Proceed to system configuration only after these checks are complete.
