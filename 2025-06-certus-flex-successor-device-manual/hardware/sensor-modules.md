# Sensor Modules

This section describes supported sensor modules and how they integrate with the device.

Sensor modules allow the device to interface with external measurement sources.

---

## Supported Sensor Types

The device supports multiple sensor module types, including:
- analog sensors
- digital sensors
- specialized measurement modules

Only approved sensor modules should be used.

---

## Installing Sensor Modules

Install sensor modules only when the device is powered off.

### Installation Steps

1. Identify the correct module slot.
2. Align the sensor module with the connector.
3. Insert the module firmly until fully seated.
4. Secure the module according to the mounting method.

Improper installation may cause communication errors.

## Sensor Identification

After installation, sensor modules are automatically detected by the system.

Detected modules are displayed in the software interface for configuration.

If a module is not detected:
- verify proper seating
- inspect the connector
- review compatibility

---

## Sensor Configuration Overview

Each sensor module requires basic configuration, such as:
- measurement range
- sampling rate
- calibration parameters

Detailed configuration procedures are described in the Software Configuration section.

## Module Handling and Replacement

When handling sensor modules:
- avoid static discharge
- do not touch connector pins
- store unused modules in protective packaging

Replace modules only with approved equivalents to ensure system compatibility.
