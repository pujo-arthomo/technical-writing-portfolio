# Normal Operation

This section describes normal device operation after installation and configuration are complete.

It explains expected system behavior during routine use and provides guidance for daily operation.

---

## Operational States

During normal operation, the device transitions through defined operational states.

Typical states include:
- startup
- standby
- active operation
- temporary idle

State transitions occur automatically based on system conditions and configuration settings.

---

## Startup Behavior

After power is applied:
- the system performs internal checks
- configuration settings are loaded
- sensor modules are initialized

Normal operation begins only after all startup checks are completed successfully.

Any abnormal behavior during startup should be investigated before proceeding.

---

## Data Acquisition and Processing

During operation:
- sensor data is collected continuously or at configured intervals
- values are processed according to defined parameters
- data is prepared for display, logging, or transmission

The device does not modify sensor data beyond documented processing steps.

---

## Monitoring During Operation

Operators should regularly monitor:
- system status indicators
- sensor readings
- communication activity

Monitoring helps detect potential issues early and supports stable long-term operation.

---

## Operational Restrictions

During normal operation:
- avoid unnecessary configuration changes
- do not disconnect sensor modules
- do not interrupt power supply

Failure to follow operational guidelines may result in data loss or device instability.
