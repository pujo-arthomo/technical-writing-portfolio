# Configuration Workflows

This section explains how to configure the device software for normal operation.

Configuration workflows guide users through required setup steps while reducing configuration errors.

---

## Configuration Prerequisites

Before configuring the software:
- hardware installation must be complete
- power and wiring must be verified
- sensor modules must be installed correctly

Configuration should not be performed on a partially installed system.

---

## Initial Configuration Workflow

Initial configuration includes:
- system identification
- communication parameters
- sensor assignment
- data handling preferences

These settings establish the baseline system behavior.

---

## Applying Configuration Changes

Configuration changes are applied through the user interface.

The software:
- validates input values
- checks for conflicts
- requires user confirmation before applying changes

Some changes may require a system reload to take effect.

---

## Configuration Validation

After configuration:
- review all settings
- verify sensor readings
- confirm communication status

Validation ensures the system operates as intended.

---

## Configuration Management Considerations

Frequent configuration changes are not recommended during normal operation.

Document all configuration changes according to site procedures to support traceability and maintenance.
