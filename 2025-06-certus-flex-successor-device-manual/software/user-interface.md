# User Interface

This section describes the software user interface used to configure, monitor, and diagnose the device.

The interface is designed to provide clear access to system information without requiring programming knowledge.

---

## Interface Access

The user interface is accessed through a supported client environment.

After successful connection, the main dashboard is displayed.

Access permissions may vary depending on user role.

---

## Main Interface Areas

The interface is organized into the following areas:

- system status display
- navigation menu
- configuration panels
- diagnostic and log views

Each area is designed to support a specific operational task.

---

## Status Indicators

Status indicators provide real-time feedback on:
- device operational state
- communication activity
- active warnings or faults

Indicators use consistent colors and symbols to convey information clearly.

---

## Navigation Principles

Navigation follows a hierarchical structure.

Users can:
- access configuration settings by category
- review diagnostics and logs
- return to the main dashboard at any time

Navigation changes do not affect active system processes unless explicitly confirmed.

---

## User Interaction Guidelines

When using the interface:
- review on-screen messages carefully
- confirm changes before applying them
- avoid modifying settings without understanding their effect

Interface changes take effect only after confirmation.
