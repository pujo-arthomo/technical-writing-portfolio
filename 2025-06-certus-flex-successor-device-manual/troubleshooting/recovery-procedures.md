# Recovery Procedures

This section describes recovery procedures to restore normal operation after a fault or failure.

Recovery actions should be performed in the order presented.

---

## General Recovery Guidelines

Before starting recovery:
- ensure the device is in a safe state
- follow site safety procedures
- record observed symptoms and fault codes

Do not attempt recovery actions without understanding the associated risks.

---

## Basic Recovery Procedure

For many non-critical issues:
1. Stop normal operation
2. Verify power and wiring connections
3. Restart the device
4. Monitor system status during startup

If the issue persists, proceed to advanced recovery steps.

---

## Configuration Recovery

If configuration issues are suspected:
1. Review current configuration settings
2. Restore known good configuration if available
3. Reapply required parameters carefully
4. Validate system behavior after restoration

Avoid repeated configuration changes without validation.

---

## Firmware Recovery

In cases of firmware-related issues:
- verify the installed firmware version
- reinstall approved firmware if necessary
- confirm successful update before resuming operation

Do not interrupt firmware recovery once initiated.

---

## Sensor and Module Recovery

For sensor-related faults:
- power off the device
- inspect and reseat affected modules
- replace modules if required
- reconfigure sensors after recovery

Ensure proper handling to prevent damage.

---

## Escalation Criteria

Escalate the issue to qualified service personnel if:
- faults recur after recovery
- critical faults cannot be cleared
- hardware damage is suspected

Do not continue operation under unresolved fault conditions.
