# Fault Codes

This section describes fault codes generated by the device and how to interpret them.

Fault codes help identify abnormal conditions and guide corrective actions.

## Fault Code Purpose

Fault codes are used to:
- identify the affected subsystem
- indicate the severity of an issue
- support faster troubleshooting

Each fault code represents a specific condition detected by the system.

---

## Fault Code Structure

Fault codes follow a standardized structure:
- a numeric or alphanumeric identifier
- a short descriptive label
- an associated severity level

Codes are grouped by subsystem for easier reference.

---

## Fault Code Categories

Fault codes are categorized as follows:

- **System Faults**  
  Related to internal system operation.

- **Sensor Faults**  
  Related to sensor modules or measurements.

- **Communication Faults**  
  Related to network or interface communication.

- **Power Faults**  
  Related to supply voltage or power stability.

## Fault Code Severity Levels

Each fault code has an associated severity:

- **Informational**  
  Indicates a non-critical condition.

- **Warning**  
  Indicates a condition that may affect operation.

- **Critical**  
  Indicates a condition that requires immediate action.

Severity levels help determine the urgency of corrective measures.

## Responding to Fault Codes

When a fault code is displayed:
1. Record the fault code and timestamp
2. Identify the affected subsystem
3. Refer to the relevant troubleshooting section
4. Apply corrective actions as recommended

Persistent or critical faults should be escalated to qualified service personnel.
