# Data Export Guide

## Purpose of Data Export

The data export feature allows users to download collected records for external use.

Exports are commonly used for:
- manual review
- lightweight analysis
- archival or sharing purposes

The feature is intentionally simple to ensure broad compatibility.

## What to Expect in an Exported File

Exported data is provided in CSV format.

Each file:
- contains one row per record
- includes column headers
- preserves the original submitted values

The export reflects stored data only and does not apply additional processing or interpretation.

## Working with Exported Data

Once downloaded, exported files can be:
- opened in spreadsheet applications
- reviewed manually
- processed using simple scripts

Users are encouraged to validate and interpret the data according to their specific needs.

## Known Limitations

The export feature:
- does not filter or transform data
- does not remove incomplete entries
- does not validate field relationships

These limitations are intentional to keep the export process predictable and transparent.
